## Development Exercise (User Story)

Build a single-page web application that implements a to-do list.

Acceptance Criteria:

	1. instructions on how to deploy your solution
	2. Any assumptions that you made
	3. a brief explanation of the design
	4. a brief explanation of your choice of technologies/frameworks used
